      <li><h5>- This hack is currently not safe to use on your main account. Only use this hack on a throwaway account.

<br><br>- Although we have an Anti-Ban, there is still a very high ban risk chance. Do not abuse the hack, do not get reported by other players, do not win every game and refrain from using the hack when a new update comes. While the anti-ban might be working now, there is no guarantee that it will continue to work on a future PUBG update. Tencent is constantly fighting hacks so check this topic daily for hack updates, information & changes! Refrain from PMing DiDA regarding PUBG, there are too many messages to answer. Always keep PUBG discussions/questions in this topic or the  PUBG MOBILE Club.
<br><br>- Use only the features you need, the more features you use, the higher the risk.
<br><br>- This Anti-Ban works with Facebook, Guest, Twitter & Game Center logins.</h></li>
